const e="Maintaining Health and Well-being",t=[{speaker:"Tom",text:"Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit out of sorts. It’s not just fatigue—it feels like my body is telling me something’s wrong."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"That’s concerning. Have you been overworking? I’ve noticed you’ve been staying late at the office quite a bit."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"You’re right. I’ve been burning the candle at both ends, and it’s starting to catch up with me. I haven’t been sleeping well, either."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"That’s a slippery slope. Sleep deprivation can wreak havoc on your immune system and overall health."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"I know. It’s just that my mind is constantly racing, especially with all the deadlines looming. It’s hard to switch off."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"It sounds like you need to find some balance. Have you tried winding down with a book or something relaxing before bed?"},{speaker:"Tom",text:"I’ve thought about it, but honestly, I tend to reach for coffee late in the evening to stay alert, which probably isn’t helping."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"Caffeine late in the day is a recipe for disaster when it comes to sleep. You might want to try herbal tea or just water in the evenings."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"I’ll give that a shot. I’ve also noticed that I’ve been skipping meals lately, which isn’t doing me any favors."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"Skipping meals? That’s definitely not helping. You need to fuel your body properly, or you’re bound to crash."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"Yeah, I can tell my energy levels have been all over the place. I need to get back on track with eating regular meals."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"Why don’t you prep some meals in advance? That way, when you're busy, you can still grab something healthy without much thought."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"That’s a solid idea. It’s about time I started prioritizing my health over work. It’s not sustainable the way things are going."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"Exactly. Your health has to come first, or eventually, everything else will suffer. Burnout is real, and it’s not worth the risk."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"I’ve been feeling like I’m on the edge of burning out for a while now. I just need to slow down and make some changes."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"It's easier said than done, but it’s necessary. Taking care of yourself should never feel like an afterthought."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"You’re right. I’m going to start small, with sleep and meals, and hopefully, the rest will fall into place."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"Good plan. Once you establish those habits, you’ll see how much better you feel. It’s all about consistency."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"Thanks for the advice. I’ve been meaning to make these changes for a while. It’s just hard to break old habits."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"One step at a time, Tom. You’ll get there. And if you need a reminder to take it easy, I’m here to nudge you."}],a=["feeling a bit out of sorts","burning the candle at both ends","catch up with me","a slippery slope","wreak havoc on","my mind is constantly racing","all the deadlines looming","winding down","to stay alert","recipe for disaster","skipping meals","isn’t doing me any favors","you’re bound to","all over the place","grab something healthy","prioritizing my health over work","on the edge of burning out","should never feel like an afterthought","fall into place","establish those habits","break old habits","I’m here to nudge you"],o=["czuję się trochę nieswojo","wypalam się z każdej strony","dogania mnie","śliska ścieżka","siać spustoszenie","moja głowa ciągle pracuje","wszystkie zbliżające się terminy","wyciszanie się","pozostać czujnym","przepis na katastrofę","pomijanie posiłków","nie przynosi mi żadnych korzyści","na pewno cię czeka","wszędzie rozproszony","złapać coś zdrowego","priorytet zdrowia nad pracą","na skraju wypalenia","nie powinno nigdy być tylko dodatkiem","wszystko się ułoży","ustanowić te nawyki","złamać stare nawyki","jestem tutaj, żeby cię zmotywować"],i=["What are the risks of neglecting your health in favor of work or other responsibilities?","How do you deal with stress when you feel overwhelmed by deadlines or obligations?","What are some small, practical changes you can make to improve your daily health and well-being?"];export{a as clickables,o as clickablesPl,t as conversation,i as discussionQuestions,e as title};
