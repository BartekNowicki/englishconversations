We get so wrapped up in deadlines and tasks that we forget to take a breather."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"Absolutely. And then when we finally do stop, we feel guilty for not being productive."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"It’s a vicious cycle. We need to remind ourselves that it’s okay to slow down sometimes."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"I agree. Maybe that’s something we can focus on next year—finding more balance."},{speaker:"Sara",text:"That sounds like a plan.
