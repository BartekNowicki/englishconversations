const e="The Passing of Time",t=[{speaker:"Lily",text:"It’s astonishing how time slips through our fingers, isn't it? It feels like summer just wrapped up, and now winter is creeping in again."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"Exactly. As we get older, time seems to accelerate. We get so caught up in our daily routines that we barely notice the seasons changing."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"Right, the days blur together, and suddenly, months have flown by. I used to look forward to winter, but now it sneaks up on me."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"When we were younger, we counted down the days to the holidays, but now they just seem to pop up out of nowhere. I guess we're too bogged down with work to appreciate the little things."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"It’s true. Life tends to pull us in so many directions, and before we know it, whole weeks have slipped away. I keep telling myself to stop and enjoy the moment, but it's easier said than done."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"Finding balance is the key. We spend so much time planning for the future that we forget to live in the present. Winter isn’t just about the cold—it's a reminder that another year is winding down."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"It hits hard when you think about all the goals you didn’t check off the list. Another year gone, and the to-do list just keeps getting longer."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"That’s the tricky part, right? We set these big ambitions, but time has a way of undermining even the best-laid plans. Maybe the trick is to be more flexible with ourselves."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"Absolutely. We need to pace ourselves, or else we’ll constantly feel like we’re racing against the clock. Winter should be a time to slow down and reflect on what really matters."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"Exactly. Instead of dreading it, maybe we should embrace the slower pace that winter brings. It’s a chance to recharge and prepare for what’s ahead."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"But it’s not always easy to adjust, is it? We get so used to running on high speed that slowing down feels unnatural."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"True. It almost feels like we’re expected to be productive all the time, even when nature tells us to slow down."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"Yes, there’s this constant pressure to always be achieving something. Sometimes, just taking a break feels like you're falling behind."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"That’s the thing. We’re conditioned to think that slowing down is a bad thing, but it’s actually essential for staying balanced."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"Exactly. Without balance, it’s easy to burn out. I’ve been learning that it’s okay to take it easy sometimes."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"That’s a lesson I’m still working on. I’m always making plans, but I need to remember to leave space for rest."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"Yes, finding that balance is a lifelong process, but we get better at it with practice."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"Hopefully! I want to make sure I’m not letting the years slip by without enjoying the present."},{speaker:"Lily",text:"That’s a good goal. Let's try to keep each other accountable next year and make sure we take time to slow down."},{speaker:"Tom",text:"Definitely. We can't let another year just disappear without making time to live in the moment."}],a=["slips through our fingers","just wrapped up","is creeping in","seems to accelerate","get so caught up in","we barely notice","blur together","months have flown by","sneaks up on me","counted down the days","pop up out of nowhere","bogged down with","appreciate the little things","pull us in so many directions","slipped away","easier said than done","winding down","It hits hard","check off the list","has a way of undermining","best-laid plans","be more flexible with","pace ourselves","racing against the clock","reflect on what really matters","embrace the slower pace","prepare for what’s ahead","running on high speed","you're falling behind","is a bad thing","take it easy","leave space for","making time to"],s=["Do you think the passage of time feels faster as we age?
