  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "That’s concerning. Have you been overworking? I’ve noticed you’ve been staying late at the office quite a bit.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "You’re right. I’ve been burning the candle at both ends, and it’s starting to catch up with me. I haven’t been sleeping well, either.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "That’s a slippery slope. Sleep deprivation can wreak havoc on your immune system and overall health.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "I know. It’s just that my mind is constantly racing, especially with all the deadlines looming. It’s hard to switch off.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "It sounds like you need to find some balance. Have you tried winding down with a book or something relaxing before bed?",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "I’ve thought about it, but honestly, I tend to reach for coffee late in the evening to stay alert, which probably isn’t helping.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "Caffeine late in the day is a recipe for disaster when it comes to sleep. You might want to try herbal tea or just water in the evenings.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "I’ll give that a shot. I’ve also noticed that I’ve been skipping meals lately, which isn’t doing me any favors.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "Skipping meals? That’s definitely not helping. You need to fuel your body properly, or you’re bound to crash.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "Yeah, I can tell my energy levels have been all over the place. I need to get back on track with eating regular meals.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "Why don’t you prep some meals in advance? That way, when you're busy, you can still grab something healthy without much thought.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "That’s a solid idea. It’s about time I started prioritizing my health over work. It’s not sustainable the way things are going.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "Exactly. Your health has to come first, or eventually, everything else will suffer. Burnout is real, and it’s not worth the risk.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "I’ve been feeling like I’m on the edge of burning out for a while now. I just need to slow down and make some changes.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "It's easier said than done, but it’s necessary. Taking care of yourself should never feel like an afterthought.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "You’re right. I’m going to start small, with sleep and meals, and hopefully, the rest will fall into place.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "Good plan. Once you establish those habits, you’ll see how much better you feel. It’s all about consistency.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Tom",
    text: "Thanks for the advice. I’ve been meaning to make these changes for a while. It’s just hard to break old habits.",
  },
  {
    speaker: "Sara",
    text: "One step at a time, Tom. You’ll get there. And if you need a reminder to take it easy, I’m here to nudge you."
